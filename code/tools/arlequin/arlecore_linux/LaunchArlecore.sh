#The script will launch arlecore on all arlequin project files in turn
#It assumes that it is launched in a directory containing:
#         - a series of *.arp files to be analysed
#         - a settings file containing the settings specifying which 
#           computations are to be performed (usually obtained through the WinArl35.exe
#           graphical interface).

#Modify the following line to state which version of arlecore you are using
arlecore=arlecore3522_64bit  #windows version
#Modify this if you wan to use another setting file
settingsFile=arl_run.ars

if [ -f $settingsFile ]; then

	#This loop will analyse all files with the same settings file
	for file in *.arp
	do  	
		echo "Processing file $file"
		#Launch arlecore with the same settings for all files
		./${arlecore}  ${file} ${settingsFile}	#run_silent
	done

	#The following loop would be an alternative to perform specific computations on each file
	#assuming that there is a different setting file with the same name as the project file, but with 
	#the extension *.ars 

	#for file in *.arp
	#do  	
	#	echo "Processing file $file"
	#	#Launch arlecore with project specific settings
	#	./$arlecore  $file ${file%.*}.ars run_silent
	#done

	echo "Settings file $settingsFile does not exist. Aborting script."
